## Constraints
1. No new libraries shall be added to complete the assessment


## How to Use
1. Open build.gradle.kts file in an IDE of your choosing (IntelliJ is my choice)
2. Once project has compiled, run the ADSBackendTest1.kt file in ads-test/src/main/kotlin/org.mbte.mdds/tests
3. The output sqlite database file will be in your user folder and the output json file will be in the ads-test/src/main/resources folder

### Optional:
If you wish to input your own contacts to the address book, you can do so in the ab.xml file in ads-test/src/main/resources
NOTE: Any additions must be in xml format as done so already in the xml file.
